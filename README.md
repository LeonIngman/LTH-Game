### Documentation Style Guide

#### Formatting Standards

- Use Markdown with consistent heading levels
- Include code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Add tables for structured information
- Use emoji sparingly but effectively for visual scanning

#### Writing Style

- **Clear and Concise**: Avoid unnecessary jargon
- **Action-Oriented**: Tell people what to do, not just what exists
- **Example-Rich**: Show concrete examples alongside explanations
- **Audience-Aware**: Consider who will read each section

#### Code Examples

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Clear, commented, realistic examples
interface UserProps {
  id: string;
  username: string;
  role: "student" | "teacher";
}

// Show usage context
function UserCard({ user }: { user: UserProps }) {
  return <div className="user-card">{user.username}</div>;
}
```
