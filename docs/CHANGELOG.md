# Changelog

## [2024-12-13] - Game State Persistence Implementation

### Added

- **Database-backed game state persistence** - Complete solution for storing and restoring player progress across sessions
  - New `GameSession` table with user_id, level_id, and JSONB game state storage
  - Unique constraints to prevent duplicate sessions per user/level combination
  - Comprehensive error handling and validation

### New Components & Hooks

- `hooks/use-persisted-game-state.ts` - Enhanced game state hook with automatic persistence

  - Debounced auto-save every 3 seconds during gameplay
  - Automatic state restoration on component mount
  - Loading states and error handling for persistence operations
  - beforeunload handler to save progress before page navigation

- `components/game/ui/save-status.tsx` - User feedback component for persistence status
  - Real-time save status indicators (Saving, Saved, Error states)
  - "Last saved" timestamp display with relative time formatting
  - Responsive design for mobile and desktop layouts

### New API Endpoints

- `app/api/game/save-game-state/route.ts` - Endpoint for saving game state
- `app/api/game/load-game-state/route.ts` - Endpoint for loading saved game state
- `app/api/game/delete-game-state/route.ts` - Endpoint for clearing saved progress

### New Database Actions

- `lib/actions/game-session.ts` - Core persistence logic
  - `saveGameSession()` - Idempotent upsert with PostgreSQL ON CONFLICT handling
  - `loadGameSession()` - Retrieve saved game state for user/level combination
  - `deleteGameSession()` - Clear saved progress (for testing and reset functionality)

### Enhanced Components

- `components/game/ui/game-header.tsx` - Updated to display save status

  - Shows persistence indicators in responsive layout
  - Integrates seamlessly with existing header design

- `components/game/game-interface.tsx` - Updated to use persistent game state
  - Replaced `useGameState` with `usePersistedGameState` hook
  - Passes save status to header component for user feedback

### Testing

- `tests/integration/game-persistence.test.ts` - Comprehensive test suite
  - Database integration tests for save/load operations
  - Error handling validation
  - Complex game state preservation verification
  - Idempotent update testing

### Database Schema Updates

- Updated `GameSession` table with proper constraints and indexes
- JSONB storage for flexible game state structure
- Unique constraint on (user_id, level_id) for session management

### Behavioral Changes

- **Game progress now persists across browser refreshes** - Primary user benefit
- Automatic saving during gameplay without user intervention
- Clear visual feedback for save operations
- Graceful error handling for database connectivity issues
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing game logic

### Technical Improvements

- Implements Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach per AI development guidelines
- Comprehensive error handling at all persistence layers
- Debounced save operations to optimize database performance
- TypeScript interfaces for type-safe persistence operations
- Clean separation of concerns between UI, API, and database layers

### User Experience Enhancements

- No more lost progress on accidental page refreshes
- Visual confirmation of save status in game header
- Automatic background saving without interrupting gameplay
- Loading indicators during state restoration

### Developer Experience

- Well-documented persistence API with clear interfaces
- Comprehensive test coverage for reliability
- Modular architecture for easy maintenance and extension
- Following established code patterns from the existing codebase
