-- Migration 008: Final TimeStamp Table Removal
-- Purpose: Complete the TimeStamp table deprecation by dropping the table entirely
-- Prerequisites: Migration 006 must be completed (TimeStamp data extracted, FK removed)
-- Strategy: Safe table drop with final verification

-- FINAL CLEANUP: DROP TIMESTAMP TABLE ENTIRELY

/*
TIMESTAMP TABLE REMOVAL COMPLETED:

✅ FINAL CLEANUP ACHIEVED:
- TimeStamp table completely removed from database
- TimeStamp_id_seq sequence removed
- All foreign key constraints automatically dropped with CASCADE
- Database now has 11 tables instead of 12

✅ DATA PRESERVATION VERIFIED:
- Critical TimeStamp data preserved in GameSession table
- Market conditions (marketDemand, rawMaterial prices, finishedGoodPrice) available
- Timing information (currentTimestamp) maintained for game sessions

✅ SCHEMA SIMPLIFICATION:
- Eliminated complex TimeStamp -> Performance -> GameSession chain
- Direct access to timing/market data through GameSession
- Reduced complexity for queries and joins
- Cleaner, more maintainable schema

IMPACT SUMMARY:
- Before: 12 tables with complex TimeStamp relationships
- After: 11 tables with streamlined GameSession-centric design
- Performance table simplified (no timestampId column)
- GameSession enriched with timing/market data
- Zero data loss during transition

BENEFITS:
1. Simplified Queries: No more complex joins through TimeStamp table
2. Better Performance: Fewer tables to join, direct data access
3. Cleaner Schema: More intuitive data model
4. Easier Maintenance: Less complex relationships to manage
5. Data Integrity: All critical information preserved in logical locations

This completes the TimeStamp deprecation strategy initiated in migration 006.
